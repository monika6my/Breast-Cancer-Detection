# Breast-Cancer-Detection
This is a part of course work for Intro to Data Science (IDS). In this project, we worked on the Kaggle Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Data to diagnose whether the patients have breast cancer or not using a decision tree ensemble algorithm XGBoost. This classifier incorporates gradient boosting framework for mininimising erorrs, and we tuned the hyperparameters to get the best results, an accuracy of 95%.
